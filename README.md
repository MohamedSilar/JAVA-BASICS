## Features ‚ú®

### **Variables and Data Types**

* Learn the different types of variables in Java and how to use them, including `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, and more.

### **Control Structures**

* Understand the use of conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) to control the flow of your program.

### **Arrays**

* Work with arrays to store and manipulate multiple values of the same type.

### **Methods**

* Learn how to create reusable code by defining and calling methods in Java.

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**

* Understand the principles of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### **Exception Handling**

* Learn how to handle errors and exceptions using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to ensure your programs run smoothly.

### **File Handling**

* Learn how to read from and write to files in Java, making your programs capable of handling data beyond memory.
